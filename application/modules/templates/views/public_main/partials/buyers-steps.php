Real estate agents are the first ones to find out about a home being placed on the market.

In addition to a public database of home listings, which we screen to find properties within your price range,&nbsp; our agents also&nbsp;have access to private and unpublished listings through&nbsp;connections with our affiliated offices.<b>&nbsp;<br><br></b>

Ask yourself some basic questions, such as: Why are you buying a new home now? Are you moving due to a lifestyle change, job relocation, or other factor? Are you committed to buying, or is renting an option? Do you have a purchasing timeframe?<b>&nbsp;</b>The more you understand about your own individual goals, the better suited you will be to jump into the marketplace. It is important to discuss these questions with your agent so everyone is on the same page from the get go.<b>&nbsp;<br><br></b>

                                                        <p>Purchasing a home is one of the biggest decisions you will make in your life. As soon as you’ve decided you want to buy a house, make certain you have a clear picture of your financial situation. It can be helpful to meet with a mortgage broker at this point; someone who can work with you to determine what you can afford&nbsp;and guide you in getting prequalified for a loan. Once you are prequalified for a loan, you will have the advantage of being able to move more swiftly when you find the right home. Think of it this way: There are likely to be other buyers interested in the home you’re eying and if you’ve already been qualified for a loan, you’re one step ahead of them in the game. (Remember though, being prequalified is not the same as being accepted).</p>

Ideally, your home will have all of your needs and as many of your wants as possible. By going through this exercise, it will help you make sure that you are comparing “apples to apples” (or “wants” to “wants”) when you begin the house hunting process. For example, it’s probably not a good idea to compromise on a “need” in order to get a “want”. Don’t be afraid to adjust your list after you’ve started to see what’s out there.</p>

You may imagine moving your furniture in, planting flowers, and hosting your first big holiday party. But try not to get too attached prematurely. There are a number of steps you must take before you’re holding the keys in your hand, and you need to think clearly and objectively at this point so that the offer you make is a realistic one.</p>

                                                        <p>There are a number of factors that will affect the offer you make. Market supply and demand, the condition of the home, how long the house has been on the market, and your personal circumstances with regard to how soon you need to close on a home, all come into play when framing your offer. If you “low ball” your offer, some sellers will react with a counter offer; others might dismiss your offer outright. In an active market, you’re likely to lose out by making a low bid. If multiple bids are anticipated, it’s advisable to go with your “best offer”. We will guide and advise you on ways to make your offer more attractive: for instance, a mortgage credit approval and flexibility on the closing\settlement date can help make your offer stand out and ultimately close the sale. After all options are considered, your purchase offer will be carefully prepared and presented by your agent.

Because counter-offers are common (any change in an offer can be considered a counter-offer), it is important for you as the buyer, to remain in close contact with your agent during the negotiation process so that any proposed changes can be reviewed quickly. We will work together to negotiate the best price possible for your home.

The home inspection should be ordered within 14 days of the contract being signed; usually it is done as soon as attorney review ends. A number of inspections are common in New Jersey residential realty transactions. They include inspection for termites and wood-boring insects, radon inspection, and mechanical and structural inspection. During these inspections, an expert comes to the property to determine if there are material physical defects in the home and whether expensive repairs and replacements are likely to be required in the next few years. Such inspections for a single-family home often require two or three hours, and buyers should attend. This is an opportunity to examine the property's mechanics and structure, ask questions and learn far more about the property than is possible with an informal walk-through.&nbsp;

You may decide that the issue is not important enough to bring up if it puts you at risk for losing the home. Any home inspection issues you choose to address should be done immediately after inspection results are received. In most cases, the seller and buyer will come to an agreement regarding these concerns. You and the seller may decide to meet in the middle and share the costs of repairs, or one party may pay for the repairs entirely. Your agent and attorney will work with you throughout these discussions.
