                                                    <p>One of the most culturally diverse communities’ in New Jersey is Teaneck. Teaneck is between the Hackensack River and the Palisades of the Hudson River. It is home to over 40,000 residents. There are numerous parks, business and cultural environments. Possibly named for a Dutch family, the Teneycks. Another tradition says the name may derive from an Indian term for "the woods".&nbsp;</p>

                                                    <p>The Township of Teaneck was established on February 19, 1895 and was comprised of parts of Englewood, Hackensack, Ridgefield Park, Bergen Fields and Bogota. The town's population was 811. During these early days of the 20th century, the town's affairs focused on construction of streets and street lamps (originally gaslights), trolley lines (along DeGraw Avenue), telephones and speeding traffic. Social activities centered on church events and harness racing at the popular racetrack on Cedar Lane, near River Road. Several small inns offered fine dining and dancing to overnight guests.</p>

                                                    <p>Express bus service to New York City via the George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel is available. Today, Teaneck continues to thrive by respecting its residents' many and diverse voices while working towards a blending of interest so all are at home and welcome here. Teaneck's ethnically diverse community as well as its array of shops and restaurants creates a welcoming environment for international students.</p>

                                                    <p>Bergenfield is a borough in eastern/central Bergen County and was incorporated in 1894 from portions of the now-gone Palisades Township and Englewood Township. The town takes its name from the 19th century train station that was originally referred to as “Bergen Fields” and later as “Bergenfield”.</p>

                                                    <p>In 2010, New Jersey Monthly magazine ranked Bergenfield as its 211st best place to live in New Jersey. In it’s previous 2008 list, Bergenfield was ranked number 231. In a 2010 Businessweek article, the borough of Bergenfield was ranked as the #2 best place in the state of New Jersey to raise children. It was praised for a community that “pulls together around a true Main Street with such events as the annual holiday display contest”. The article also mentioned the town pool and the numerous town parks.</p>

                                                    <p>Although Bergenfield no longer has train access, the town has public bus service to New York City and is located just a few miles from route 4 and 16 miles from New York City.</p>

                                                    <p>New Milford, a borough which spans 2.308 square miles, was officially formed from the remaining land that made up Palisades Township in March of 1922 and is known as the birthplace of Bergen County. The Historic Preservation Commission’s mission is to preserve the integrity of New Milford’s historic heritage in many ways. The Commission aims to fulfill this duty through researching the people, events, and locations that are of historic value and archiving, thus preserving, buildings, land, and historic items. Through public education programs and commendations for borough residents and organizations who have offered assistance with this task, the mission of the Commission, to spread the knowledge of the borough’s history, can thrive.</p>

It also offers a wide range of relatively affordable single-family houses within commuting distance from Manhattan.</p>

                                                        <br> Englewood is located at the tip of Bergen County. It is a place where the pleasures of hometown meet worldly, sophisticated taste. It has a vibrant downtown full of shopping; dining and culture that you will want to visit again and again. At present Englewood is a sophisticated city which combines much of its historic grace and charm with an exciting cosmopolitan atmosphere. It has many contrasts - between elaborate Victorian mansions and modern low-rise condominiums, between quiet tree-lined residential neighborhoods and the bustling central business district, between large estates and affordable apartments. There are hundreds of incredible shops that have put Englewood on the map of savvy shopaholics for generations. Couture labels, children’s clothes, Tibetan carpets, upscale consignment, diamonds, art, antiques, rare orchids, kitchen appliances, custom-mixed paints… all, much and more, are right next door to bagel stores, bakeries, neighborhood bodegas, and, of course, Baumgarts Café and Soda Fountain that’s been holding its place in the heart of downtown for decades.</p>

                                                    <p>Englewood's proximity to New York City continues to be a significant feature, but it also has a vital and distinctive character of its own, forged from the richly heterogeneous backgrounds, interests and talents of its citizens. The residents take the Cities Trolley Shuttle to and from the commuter bus lines in the mornings and evenings. Englewood's population is far more diverse than that of most suburbs, including many of its Bergen County neighbors. Occupations range from highly paid professionals to unskilled trades. Due to the proximity of New York hospitals and the ever-expanding Englewood Hospital and Medical Center, doctors abound. There are also many lawyers, business men and women, engineers and professors, as well as a number of artists, musicians, and entertainment and sports figures. One of many distinguished residents was Dizzy Gillespie, after whom a downtown area is named.</p>

                                                    <p>The native Lenni Lenape Indians gave Paramus its name. It comes from the Lenape word “peramsepuss” sometimes translated as “land of the wild turkeys” or “fertile fields where turkeys are found.” A large metal statue of a wild turkey can be found today at the Paramus Park Mall.</p>

                                                    <p>Following the opening of the George Washington Bridge in 1931 and the development boom that followed World War II, Paramus was transformed into a shopping mecca. N.J.’s first shopping centers, the Garden State Plaza and the Bergen Mall (known today as the Bergen Town Center) opened in 1957 and 1958. The borough now contains four major shopping malls and three corporate parks which lie astride Routes 4, 17 and the Garden State Parkway.</p>

                                                    <p>Paramus is home to Bergen Community College, the Bergen Museum of Art and Science, the New Jersey Children’s Museum and four golf courses: Arcola Country Club, Paramus Golf and Country Club, Ridgewood Country Club and Orchard Hills County Golf Course.<b>&nbsp;</b>

                                                    <p>An historic account of Fair Lawn would be incomplete without the acknowledgment of the Lenni-Lenapi ("original people"), native tribes of northern New Jersey. Their trails, campsites, rock shelters and hunting grounds became the roads and towns we use and reside in today. The first Dutch settlers traveled up, what we now know as, the Hackensack and Passaic Rivers, to establish fur trading posts with the Hackinghaesaky Indians, one of the tribes of the Lenni-Lenapi. The great chief of the tribes was Oratam. As settlements expanded, the Lenni-Lenapi were forced further west to unsettled land. They left behind place names of Indian origin. Few of us realize how many indigenous names still remain, for example: Passaic (either "where the river goes over the falls" or "valley"), Paramus ("fine stream" or "place of wild turkeys"), Wagaraw ("crooked place" or "river bend"). Typically, River Road, one of the oldest roads in the eastern part of our country, was once an Indian trail, leading to the "Great Rock" tribal council site in Glen Rock.</p>

                                                    <p>Fair Lawn's pinnacle of growth was during the 1940s and 1950s. Expansive areas of farm lands were developed for single-family homes and several large garden apartment complexes. The population exploded from 9,000 in 1940 to an estimated peak of about 37,000 in 1968. Fair Lawn Industrial Park (on Route 208) was developed during the 1950s with several additions in the following decade. Among the Industrial Park's corporate residents are internationally known firms such as Kodak, Nabisco and Lea &amp; Perrins.</p>

                                                    <p>By 1970, the remaining large tracts of land had been urbanized. The last farm in Fair Lawn was a 20 acre tract in the Industrial Park at Fair Lawn Avenue. In 1998, this tract was developed into apartments.</p>

                                                    <p>What began as an agricultural community has grown into a suburban town providing homes, schools, parks and shops for residents and jobs for thousands of workers in businesses, offices and industries.</p>

                                                    <p>Maywood is ranked high among the townships of the county for its diversity, beautiful scenery and productiveness of its land. In 1894, the approximate 1.1 square mile area that includes the historic Maywood Station, formerly part of Midland Township, was incorporated as the Borough of Maywood. Until the late 1800s, the community was rural, with construction of roads, sidewalks, and streetlights not beginning until 1892.</p>

                                                    <p>Hoboken was first settled as part of the Pavonia, New Netherland colony in the 17th century. During the early 19th century, the city was developed first as a resort and later as a residential neighborhood. It became a township in 1849 and was incorporated as a city in 1855. Its waterfront was an integral part of the Port of New York and New Jersey and home to major industries for most of the 20th century.</p>

                                                    <p>Hoboken is part of the New Jersey Gold Coast. The character of the city has changed from a blue collar town to one of upscale shops and condominiums. The city is part of the New York metropolitan area and contains Hoboken Terminal, a major transportation hub for the region.</p>

                                                    <p>The initial presence of artists and young people changed the perception of the city such that others perceived it as an interesting, safe, exciting, and desirable place to live. The process continued as many suburbanites, transplanted Americans, internationals, and immigrants (mostly focused on opportunities in NY/NJ region and proximity to Manhattan, NY) began to make Hoboken their home, and the "real-estate boom" of the era encouraged many to seek investment opportunities.</p>
